Please see table below for results of image optimization.

I used the Bloglist project created in FullStackOpen MOOC.

Changes:

- The node:alpine was already in use.
- Combined RUN commands.
- Created a non-root user.
- Implemented multi-stage build.

Observations:

- The image size got reduced by 46 percent!
- Installing dotenv and cross-env adds 47MB to the image size. I believe installing these could be skipped but it would require changes to the app itself, which is not in the scope of this exercise. Additionally, two separate Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend, composed with Docker Compose, wouldn't be a bad idea.
